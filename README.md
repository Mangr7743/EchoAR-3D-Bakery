## Inspiration

With the on going pandemic, ordering food has become more prevalant then ever. We had the idea to potentially collaborate with various online food delivery services such as UberEats or SkipTheDishes and use echoAR to allow users to view the food in augmented reality on their phones.

## What it does

We created a mock restaurant web app with a menu that features QR codes using echoAR where people can scan the code and see a picture of the food in augmented reality on their phones.

## How we built it

We started with creating a web app using react.js of a mock restaurant bakery and used echoAR cloud-service to upload 3D models of food which can be viewed in augmented reality from scanning a QR code.

## Challenges we ran into

We are all junior programmers so we ran into issues with echoAR and creating our web app.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We managed to create a working web app and used echoAR to implement images in augmented reality and 3D.

## What we learned

We learned how to use React and some introductory features of echoAR.

## What's next for 3D-Bakery-EchoAR

Our next step is to potentially seek out local restaurants that may be interested in this concept. We would then create a much more fleshed out web app as well as explore other features of echoAR to enhance our web app.
